# Material Design Lite Encapsulated

##### Fork of [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) (MDL).

This fork attempts to add a graceful patch to enable MDL encapsulation as Module or fallback to vendor under global window.
In addition it has option to build MDL suited to widgets by encapsulating and prefixing the css in addition to JS encapsulation.
This fork tracks the [mdl-1.1](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/tree/mdl-1.1) branch of the MDL. This is due to the following note:
>*** Important note for contributors - The master branch now has breaking V2 changes. As such it can not be merged into mdl-1.1. If you are making a contribution to 1.1, then please send pull requests directly to that branch. We will routinely merge that back into master. Thank you!

Please refer to [Issue 1730](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/issues/1730) of the official MDL.

The patch:
```
gulpfile.babel.js           // add all:encap, jspm:release, widget tasks, minor modification to scripts task
src/encapsulationPatch.js   // new JS (10 lines)
src/mdlExport.js            // new JS (30 lines)
test/index.html             // add SystemJS to load mdl as module, add MDL components to global scope for mocha tests
package.json                // add jspm configuration
```

## Build

### MDL as Module
Encapsulates only the JS code as module.

Run:
```
gulp all:encap
```    
To build and test (SystemJS is used for loading mdl as module for testing).

Exported:
```
// In your index.html or app.js
System.import('material.js').then(function (mdl) {
  mdl.componentHandler;
  mdl.components;            // all the Material design objects (MaterialButton, MaterialMenu, etc)
}
```

If module not used (script tag loading), falls back to encapsulation under:
```
window[vendor].mdl
```
* The task expects -v [NAME] parameter
* If none given, default "Google" is used
* MDL objects and functions encapsulated as fallback inside window[vendor].mdl

To specify "foo" vendor run:
```
gulp all:encap -v foo
```

### MDL for Widgets
Encapsulates JS code as module (same as above).
In addition, allows prefixing all the standard element with .vendor class, so `h3 {}` becomes `.vendor h3 {}`.
>***Note:*** Prefixing all the MDL classes such as `mdl-button` is problematics since & SASS operator is used
across the code.

For custom widgets `mdl-` prefix of all the mdl classes can be modified so `mdl-button` can become `foo-button`.
>***Note:*** customizing `mdl-` prefix patches the JS code and mocha tests (during the test itself, not the sources).
 Make sure you use the `foo-button`, `foo-layout`, etc in your html.

Run:
```
gulp widget
```
The task accepts 2 parameters:
* -v [VENDOR] parameter to specify vendor
* If none given, default "Google" is used
* MDL objects and functions encapsulated as fallback inside window[vendor].mdl
and
* -p [PREFIX] parameter to specify `mdl-` customization.
* If none given, `mdl-` is not modified.

To specify "foo" vendor and "fa" prefix run:
```
gulp widget -v foo -p fa
```
So
```
h2 {}
.mdl-button {}
/* becomes */
.foo h2 {}
.fa-button {}
```

>***Note:*** This build doesn't build the demos and templates yet.

Widgets specific changes:
```
src/material-design-lite-widget.scss  // copy of src/material-design-lite.scss with minor changes
src/template-widget.scss              // copy of src/template.scss with minor changes
src/resets/_resets-widget.scss        // copy of src/resets/_resets.scss with minor changes
src/resets/_h5bp-widget.scss          // copy of src/resets/_h5bp.scss with minor changes
```

#### Make use of Widget specific resets
Resets to standard elements `h1`, `p`, `video`, etc are prefixed by the vendor class so should work as is.
>***Note:*** MDL doesn't use !important for all the resets, so if the hosting website does, there can be issues.

For `html` and `body` tags, convention was used:
The tags are replaced by `.mdl-html` and `.mdl-body` classes, so use you could use them as the widget container under the
vendor class.
>***Note:*** if you compile with custom prefix lets say `fa`, they will become `.fa-html` and `fa-body` same as other `mdl-` prefixed classes.

## JSPM

[Jspm](http://jspm.io/) package configuration was added as well.

Running:
```
gulp jspm:release
```
Will generate "jspm_release" folder. used as directories.lib

Check out the [jsp-releasa branch](https://github.com/genadis/encapsulated-mdl/tree/jspm-release)
>***Note:*** the released versions are MDL as Module builds, for Widget builds use the build instructions as it's vendor specific.

### Versioning
Notice the Major is 2.X.x instead of 1.X.X since building encapsulated version does not populate componentHandler into global scope - changes API.

You can always run the usual:
```
gulp all
```
To build and test the regular global version of MDL.

> An implementation of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
components in vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML.

Material Design Lite (MDL) lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your
static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or
libraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older
browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

## Want to contribute?

If you found a bug, have any questions or want to contribute. Follow our
[guidelines](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),

[wiki](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki).

If you are submitting a bug fix or a new component for the 1.x line, please send those into `mdl-1.x` currently.

The `master` branch is where we are working on 2.0.
It is currently **highly** experimental and no support building or using it will be provided.

## Use MDL on your site?

### Download / Clone

Clone the repo using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/material-design-lite.git
```

Alternatively you can [download](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/archive/master.zip)
this repository.

Windows users, if you have trouble compiling due to line endings then make sure
you configure git to checkout the repository with `lf` (unix) line endings. This
can be achieved by setting `core.eol`.

```bash
git config core.eol lf
git config core.autocrlf input
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

> Remember, the master branch is considered unstable. Do not use this in
production. Use a tagged state of the repository, npm, or bower for stability!

## Feature requests

If you find MDL doesn't contain a particular component you think would be
useful, please check the issue tracker in case work has already started on it.
If not, you can request a [new component](https://github.com/Google/material-design-lite/issues/new?title=[Component%20Request]%20{Component}&body=Please%20include:%0A*%20Description%0A*%20Material%20Design%20Spec%20link%0A*%20Use%20Case%28s%29).
Please keep in mind that one of the goals of MDL is to adhere to the Material
Design specs and therefore some requests might not be within the scope of this
project.
